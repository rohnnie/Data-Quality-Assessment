# Data Quality Assessment

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project on data quality assessment, focusing on identifying and mitigating issues in datasets sourced from NYC Open Data. The project aims to automate the detection of suspicious or anomalous values within datasets, enhancing data reliability and accuracy for data-driven decision making.

## Contents

- `scripts/`: Contains the code implementation for detecting outliers and handling missing values in numeric and string-valued columns.
- `data/`: Includes sample datasets sourced from NYC Open Data for testing and evaluation purposes.
- `tracker-files/`: Includes few datasets along with their tracker files that contain original values.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Project Overview

The project explores various techniques for data quality assessment, with a focus on detecting outliers, handling missing values, and identifying semantic anomalies and misspellings. It incorporates methodologies from knowledge discovery in databases and outlier detection literature.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `scripts/` directory.
3. Run the scripts for outlier detection and missing value handling on your datasets.
4. Evaluate the performance of the methods using the provided sample datasets or your own data.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or new features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
